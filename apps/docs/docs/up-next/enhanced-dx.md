# Enhanced Developer Experience

VBox supports design tokens (for example fs-xl, cl-red-400) to keep styling
consistent and expressive.

An upcoming enhancement will improve IDE feedback by exposing resolved token
values directly in the editor, for example showing the computed raw value when
hovering over a token.
